## Abstract

While Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as foundation models for visual recognition, their high computational demands hinder deployment on edge platforms. Temporal redundancy across video frames offers a natural opportunity to reuse prior computations; however, existing methods remain far from ideal, often relying on simple frame-difference signals. To address this, we propose Ouroboros, a framework that encompasses geometric redundancy from spatial displacement of content. We achieve this by aligning invariant content to consistent coordinates across frames, enabled by warping each frame into a global coordinate system via motion vectors from a hardware-accelerated encoder. Yet, this design raises two key challenges: (i) preserving content that drifts out of the limited coordinate system and (ii) maintaining spatial continuity at frame borders. Ouroboros resolves these challenges by introducing a toroidal (i.e., wrap-around) input space and reassigning positional encodings to track displaced content. Leveraging the significant patch reduction via a system-efficient partial computation scheme, our approach accelerates inference by up to 2.61× and reduces energy consumption by 64.5% on NVIDIA Jetson Orin devices, with <1% accuracy loss on object detection and instance segmentation, outperforming prior methods. Designed to process only non-redundant patches, Ouroboros also excels as an offloading system, yielding higher accuracy at lower bandwidth compared to prior schemes.
